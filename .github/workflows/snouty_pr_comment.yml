##
# Snouty is a github action build pipeline that attempts to build
# docker images and call an Antithesis webhook at the end of the process
# It is intended to work with a Pull Request (PR) request comment
#
# It requires the following:
# 1. /.antithesis/env file with REGISTRY, REPOSITORY, WEBHOOK_USER, WEBHOOK_URL environment variables defined
# 2. configure github secrets for a REST_API, ANTITHESIS_GAR_JSON_KEY and WEBHOOK_PASSWORD 
# 3. Place this workflow yml in your ./github/workflows directory
# For more information, see antithesis.com 
# 
# To use snouty, simply type "snouty test [service]"
# [service] should be a directory in the repo that contains a Dockerfile that can be used
# to run docker build command
